  blogDescription:
    'Our studio was founded with social responsibility at heart. We are aiming to find talent among people in need, who lost their homes and jobs during the war, who had to flee their country, or disadvantaged people who are simply overlooked in our society. We are working together with social enterprises around the world. The beneficiaries of our projects are significantly changed and empowered - they gain new skills, start earning a living  and above all, regain self-confidence.',
